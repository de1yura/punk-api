this project was given as a challenge to create a website using react that can call data from an api and use filters given a wireframe and component tree brakedown. i further added my own extention to the challenge by adding a dark theme to the website and also a log in page using firebase login. The user can see their credentials if signed in successfully in the navbar. 

this project was my first react app that used an api to work on data from, which proved to be challenging. My first greatest obstacle was calling the api. i noticed that when i fetched the data sometimes it would work, however other times it would refuse to work at all and ran into errors. This was when i understood the importance of conditional rendering, and implemented it to only run the codes once the api call was true. have a look around my code and view the deployment of the website via my portfolio link for Punk-API.
